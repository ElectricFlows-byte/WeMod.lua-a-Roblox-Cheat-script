Hi! This is the early access version of WeMod.lua.
This is still a work in progress. Please don’t copy or redistribute my work without permission.

I’m not an exploiter — I wrote this script for fun and to learn. It’s designed to mod games in a lightweight way without loading hundreds of scripts.

For now, the source code isn’t open-source. Once the project is complete and people know it’s my work, I may release it openly.

Thank you for respecting my work, and have fun modding your games!
